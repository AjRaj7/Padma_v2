## üé® Design Philosophy

### "Less, but Luminous"
Every element serves a purpose. No decoration for decoration's sake. Each interaction should feel intentional and meaningful.

### "Digital Ink on Polished Obsidian"
The interface should feel like writing with light on a dark, polished surface. Elegant, minimal, with subtle luxury touches.

### "Thumb-First Design"
Primary actions live in the bottom 40% of the screen. Everything should be reachable with one hand, naturally.

### "Mindful by Default"
The app should promote reflection and awareness, never shame or stress. Financial management should feel calming, not anxiety-inducing.

### Development Guidelines

2. **Mobile Obsessed**: Test on actual devices, especially OnePlus Nord 2
3. **Accessibility Matters**: Screen readers, high contrast, motor accessibility
4. **Data Sovereignty**: Users own their data completely
